Legal texts are often amended as a society or judicial system evolves. Norms and rules are valid in a particular interval of time and with respect to three main legal axes: when they come into force (entry), when they effect the intended or desired result (efficacy), and when they apply (applicability). In this section, we model the external temporal dimensions of the norms (e.g., when the norm is valid) and not the temporal dimensions of the complex events that are the content of the textual provision (e.g., when a person is to present a tax application). Therefore, we only model the intervals and temporal parameters that define the period of validity of the rules. Moreover, in keeping with the sources, it is important to link the temporal parameters to any part of a rule (e.g. atom, rel, ind, if, then, etc.) with a very fine granularity.
