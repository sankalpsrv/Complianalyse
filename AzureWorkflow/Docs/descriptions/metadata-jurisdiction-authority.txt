The Jurisdiction element is a geographic area or subject-matter over which an Authority applies its legal power. It annotates the legal rules that are applicable to a given area or subject-matter (e.g. the rules applicable only in Scotland respect the all UK legal rules).

We can use <lrml:Jurisdiction> also to specify a limited subject-matter, for instance, legal rules which are applicable only to the executive departments (e.g., an Executive Order in the USA is addressed only to the executive departments or agencies).

Similarly to the jurisdiction, authority qualifies the rules with respect to the authenticity of the provenance of the formal model. Authority is a person or organization with the power to create, endorse, or enforce Legal Norms.
