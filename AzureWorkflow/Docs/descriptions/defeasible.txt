Defeasibility is the property that a conclusion is open in principle to revision in case more evidence to the contrary is provided. Defeasible reasoning is in contrast to monotonic reasoning of propositional logic, where no revision is possible. In addition, defeasible reasoning allows reasoning in the face of contradictions, which gives rise to ex false quodlibet in propositional logic. One application of defeasible reasoning is the ability to model exceptions in a simple and natural way.
