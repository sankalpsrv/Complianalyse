 In Legal Theory norms are classified mostly in two main categories: constitutive norms and prescriptive norms, which will be then represented as constitutive rules (also known as counts-as rules) and prescriptive rules.[6]

The function of constitutive norms is to define and create so called institutional facts [39], where an institutional fact is how a particular concept is understood in a specific institution. Thus, constitutive rules provide definitions of the terms and concepts used in a jurisdiction. On the other hand, prescriptive rules dictate the obligations, prohibitions, permissions, etc. of a legal system, along with the conditions under which the obligations, prohibitions, permissions, etc. hold.

Glossary definitions for these statements are as follows:

Statements +:  a collection where every member is a Legal Statement or a FactualStatement.

ReparationStatement: a Legal Statement of a Reparation.

PrescriptiveStatement +: a Legal Statement which prescribes behaviors, e.g. with Permissions, Obligations, or Prohibitions on states, actions, or courses of actions.

PenaltyStatement +: a Legal Statement of a sanction (e.g. a punishment or a correction).

OverrideStatement +: a Legal Statement of an Override.

ConstitutiveStatement +: a Legal Statement that defines concepts and does not prescribe behaviors.

FactualStatement +: an expression of fact.
