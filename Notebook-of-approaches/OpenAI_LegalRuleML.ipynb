    "Model used: gpt-4-0125-preview (latest as of 1st February, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First approach was simply asking the model to encode the entire act in LegalRuleML format via *zero-shot prompting*. Only the preamble and first 200 or so odd words were encoded, that too without specific classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Truncation* was checked with zero-shot prompting. The same approach being repeated for the succeeding two sections which contain penalties similarly resulted in a broad classification. However, this time the full input text was being returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hence, the next step was to provide context by way of example, or *few shot prompting*. This resulted in conversion to the schema of the same act.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, it was considered that it might be difficult to generate a new context for each inference, hence a portion of a couple of different statute and rules was provided, and it resulted in accurately converting to LegalRuleML to a sufficient degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: By converting to a sufficient degree, I mean that it is able to provide enough information to work with, but in order to maintain consistency in XML tags/data across the truncated parts of a statute, more solutions will have to be explored."
