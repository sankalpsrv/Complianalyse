    "So far, it has been observed that prompt engineering using few shot examples from the LegalRuleML core specification (v1.0) can generate an XML that is satisfactory at least as a starting point. However, one of the problems faced in this process is that of non-observance of some of the rules of the schema. Using the metamodel provided by the LegalRuleML provides a hint as to what an ideal representation should be.\n",

       "BaseMessage(content='The Collatz Conjecture is a longstanding open problem in mathematics, and it is difficult to predict with certainty whether it will be solved in the future. However, the conjecture has been extensively studied and many attempts have been made to prove it, but so far, no one has been able to find a rigorous proof.\\n\\nThe Collatz Conjecture is a simple-sounding problem: given a positive integer, repeatedly apply the simple transformation: if the number is even, divide it by 2, and if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture states that no matter what positive integer you start with, this process will always converge to the number 1.\\n\\nDespite the simplicity of the conjecture, it has proven to be extraordinarily difficult to prove or disprove. Many mathematicians have attempted to solve it, but so far, no one has been able to find a rigorous proof or counterexample. In fact, the Collatz Conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, and it has been called the \"most interesting unsolved problem in number theory.\"\\n\\nThere are several reasons why the Collatz Conjecture is so difficult to solve:\\n\\n1. Complexity of the problem: The Collatz Conjecture is a very simple-sounding problem, but it is actually incredibly complex. The number of possible starting values is infinite, and the number of possible sequences of steps is also infinite. This makes it difficult to keep track of all the possible outcomes and to prove that the conjecture is true for all of them.\\n2. Lack of a general proof: Despite much effort, no one has been able to find a general proof of the Collatz Conjecture. Many special cases have been proven, but a general proof has yet to be found.\\n3. Computational difficulties: Computing the outcome of the Collatz sequence for very large starting values is difficult, even with modern computational power. This makes it difficult to verify the conjecture for all possible starting values.\\n4. Deep mathematical questions: The Collatz Conjecture is closely related to many deep mathematical questions, such as the distribution of prime numbers, the properties of the golden ratio, and the structure of the integers. These questions are still not fully understood, and understanding them could help solve the Collatz Conjecture.\\n\\nIn summary, while it is difficult to predict whether the Collatz Conjecture will be solved in the future, it is clear that it is a fundamental and important problem in mathematics that has many deep connections to other areas of mathematics. Despite much effort, no one has been able to find a rigorous proof or counterexample, and the conjecture remains one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.', type='assistant')"

In the `lrml:hasQualification` element, I added the `over` and `under` attributes to specify the Legal Rules that the qualification applies to. In this case, the qualification applies to the `psInfo1` context and the `psInfo2` context.\\n2. In the `lrml:PrescriptiveStatement` element, I updated the `lrml:if` element to include the `lrml:Override` element, which indicates that the statement is defeasible.\\n3. In the `lrml:then` element of the `lrml:if` element, I updated the `lrml:Obligation` element to include the `lrml:Override` element, which indicates that the obligation is defeasible.\\n4. I added the `lrml:DefeasibleStrength` element to the `lrml:Obligation` element to indicate that the obligation is defeasible.\\n\\nBy making these changes, the XML now aligns with the definition of defeasibility provided in the LegalRuleML metamodel.'"
