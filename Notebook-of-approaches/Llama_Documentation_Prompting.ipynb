    "### Introduction\n",
    "The LegalRuleML Core specification is a vaste repository of normative and non-normative ontologies for the XML file format generation. This also contains examples that can be utilised to feed Llama along with a system prompt. The model used is Llama2-7b-chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ToC\n",
    "\n",
    "In [**Approach 1**](#Approach1), the few shot example given is a previously generated XML file.\n",
    "In [**Approach 2**](#Approach2), the examples given in Section 6 of the Core specification are fed to Llama2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "While in the first approach, the model ignored the fact that Constitutive Rules and associations may be present, the better quality of the prompts gave a significant improvement. However, the issue of rationalising the separately fed prompts across different sections of the statute will require perhaps a **larger context window** or **XML tweaking**"
